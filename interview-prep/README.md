1. Deep copy vs shallow copy in JavaScript

Answer: Yes, so if I have to define it in terms of a very naive words, I would say that shallow copy only copies the top level hierarchy. And deep copy is like making a copy of the entire object. So shallow copy is like pretty easy to achieve in JavaScript. You just have to use the spread operator, or you can use object or assign but if you have to go about deep copy, there are multiple ways to do it. If you want the shortest way, just use JSON dot Stringify and parse it. Otherwise, you would have to write a function where you recursively iterate each and every property and then create a deep copy of the entire object.

2. Shallow copy and deep copy used in React

Answer: Got it. So when you're using React, I think most of the developers or most of I would say use cases would be solved by using just a shallow copy. And even react relies on the concept of shallow copy itself. So, there is a concept called pure component or react dot memo in React which heavily relies on the concept of shallow copy. If I have to talk about deep copy, then there are very weird or a very unique use cases where you actually want to use the copy for example, you want to achieve perfect immutability of data. You don't you created a object and now you don't want to change it no matter what. And if you want to change it, you still want to persist the original version. And then create a new version out of it. That would be the only use case behind creating a deep copy here.

3. React Vs AngularJS

Answer: To be honest, I was working with Angular JS long time back and there. So AngularJS actually became really popular because of its two way data binding. That was something which we like as UI developers have never seen happening. It was very unique concept. But there were a lot of negatives with Angular that as the scale of the application would grow, your application becomes more and more slow. And the reason behind this was Angular was you know, focusing around updating the entire dome again and again. So a lot of people were doing a lot of research around, you know, finding solutions, and the best solution that came forward was react. What react does is say you have the virtual DOM concept, though virtual DOM is actually not related to react. So it's a unique concept, which is used by other frameworks like Vue js as well. But it does is it basically finds out the differences between virtual DOM and real DOM and only updates the required differences to the real DOM, not update the entire real DOM. So that actually brings a very big performance boost. Facebook used it in their application, then they made it open source and almost like all the applications today are, you know, either using React or they're trying to migrate to react for this exact performance boost. Yep. That's how I actually ended up using React and have been using it for almost five to six years
